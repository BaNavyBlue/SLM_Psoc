This is the source code for the SARALAB Time Master, PSoC 5lp micro controller. This repo contains the original UART implementation intended to be accessed VIA a serial terminal like Tera Term, as well as the USB version intended to be used with the SI_UI Code.

These configuration files are generated using PSOC Creator 4.4 and require the IDE for editing everything except the main.c file.
